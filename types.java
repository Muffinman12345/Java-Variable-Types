#We can start with an int, a variable that hold just numbers (no decimals)

int myInt = 45;

#Remember, every java line of code (except for loops) have a ; at the end.
#We can also make a double, a number that can have decimals.

float myFloat = 3.1415f;

#Make sure you have the f at the end. This helps Java figure out which type of decimal variable you are creating. 
#The other type of decimal variable is a double. It can hold more decimals. You do not need an f

double myDouble = 3.1415926;

#You might not want a number, but a character (4, f, @, ', etc)...

char myChar = '3';

#myChar is a Character.

#A string is multiple characters.

String myString = "ddfunk2";

#After we have all these variables, we want to print them out! 

#You can print something like this:

System.out.println(myDouble);
#Remember the ;
#If you want to print something without going to the next line (what ln does), you can remove the ln

System.out.print(myDouble);
#If you want to print out something without making a variable, feel free to use quotations!

System.out.println("Hi! My name is ddfunk2.");
#I almost forgot the ;
